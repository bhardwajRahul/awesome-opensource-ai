# CI Health Workflow for awesome-opensource-ai

This document defines the automated workflow for maintaining CI health on the awesome-opensource-ai repository.

## Validation Rules

The CI validator (`tools/validate_awesome.py`) checks:

### Structural Checks
- Entry format: `- **[Label](URL)** ![GitHub stars](badge) - Description`
- All GitHub repos must have a stars badge matching the repo
- No duplicate entries within the same section
- Table of contents anchors must match section headings

### Remote GitHub Checks (README.md - Elite Tier)
- **Minimum stars**: 1000+
- **Maximum staleness**: 183 days (6 months) since last push
- **Archived repos**: flagged as warnings
- **Disabled repos**: flagged as warnings

### Remote GitHub Checks (EMERGING.md - Emerging Tier)
- **Maximum stars**: 1000 (to stay in emerging)
- **Maximum staleness**: 183 days (6 months) since last push
- **Archived repos**: flagged as warnings

## Auto-Fix Workflow

When CI fails, follow this priority order (max 5 entries per run):

### 1. Fix Structural Errors
- Missing closing brackets in markdown
- Missing GitHub stars badges
- Malformed entry syntax

### 2. Remove Stale Repos (>183 days)
Check last push date. If >183 days:
- Remove from README.md or EMERGING.md
- Commit with message: `Remove stale repo: {name} (inactive {days} days)`

### 3. Handle Star Threshold Violations

**README.md entries** (must have 1000+ stars):
- If stars < 1000: Remove or move to EMERGING.md
- If stars dropped below threshold: Remove with message: `Remove {name} ({stars} stars below 1000 threshold)`

**EMERGING.md entries** (must have <1000 stars):
- If stars >= 1000: Move to appropriate section in README.md
- Commit with message: `Promote {name} to README.md ({stars} stars, now elite-tier)`

### 4. Handle Archived Repos
- Archived repos get a warning (not error)
- If archived + stale (>183 days): Remove
- Commit with message: `Remove archived repo: {name} (archived, inactive {days} days)`

### 5. Handle Duplicates
- Remove duplicate entries within the same section
- Keep the first occurrence
- Commit with message: `Remove duplicate entry: {name}`

## Commit Message Format

```
Fix validation errors: {brief description}

- {action} {repo_name} ({reason})
- {action} {repo_name} ({reason})
...
```

Examples:
- `Fix markdown syntax: add missing closing brackets for Mastra and FlashRAG entries`
- `Remove entries failing validation: bigcode-evaluation-harness (inactive 266 days), llama-agents (344 stars below 1000 threshold)`
- `Promote project to elite-tier: project-name (1250 stars, active)`

## Verification

After committing fixes:
1. Wait for CI to run on the commit
2. Verify CI passes (0 errors, 0 warnings)
3. If still failing, iterate (max 5 entries per run)
